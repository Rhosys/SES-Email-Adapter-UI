This document is the working specification for the Vue 3 frontend that talks to
the `ses-email-adapter` API. It is the canonical source for what's in scope and
the order in which features land.

The authoritative product spec lives in `rhosys/ses-email-adapter` on branch
`claude/build-ai-app-ECGgR` (`TODO.md`). When that document changes, sync the
UI section into this file and re-export `src/types/server.ts` from the server's
`src/types/index.ts`.

## API Breaking Changes — must reconcile before shipping

The backend API was modernized after the UI scaffolding was written. The current
`src/lib/api.ts` uses the old shapes. Full reference is in `../backend/TODO.md`
under "API Breaking Changes". Summary of what affects the site:

### Collection envelope

All list calls now return named collections, not `{ items, total }`:

```ts
// Current (wrong)
const { items, nextCursor, total } = await api.listArcs(...)

// Correct
const { arcs, pagination } = await api.get<{ arcs: Arc[]; pagination: { cursor: string | null } }>('/arcs')
```

Affected endpoints: `GET /arcs`, `GET /arcs/:id/signals`, and all future list
endpoints (`/views`, `/labels`, `/rules`, `/domains`, `/aliases`, `/users`,
`/forwarding-addresses`, `/search`).

Cursor pagination: `nextCursor` is gone. Use `pagination.cursor` (always
present, `null` means end of list). `total` is also gone.

### Error shape

```ts
// Current (wrong)
{ error: string }

// Correct
{ title: string; errorCode?: string; details?: unknown }
```

### Mutations return full resource

All PATCH and POST calls return the created/updated resource. The site already
does this correctly (stores use the response body directly).

### Aliases: PUT → PATCH, new POST

```
POST  /aliases          → create (409 if duplicate)
PATCH /aliases/:address → partial update / upsert (was PUT)
DELETE /aliases/:address → 204 No Content (was 200)
```

### New signal draft endpoints (needed for Phase 4 reply composer)

```
PATCH  /signals/:id       → update draft fields
POST   /signals/:id/send  → send draft
DELETE /signals/:id       → discard draft
```

The reply composer in `ReplyComposer.vue` is currently disabled pending these
endpoints being available.

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Vue 3 + `<script setup>` + TypeScript
- **Build:** Vite 6
- **Routing:** Vue Router 4
- **State:** Pinia
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`) themed with Catppuccin
  (Latte, Frappé, Macchiato, Mocha)
- **Auth:** `@authress/login`
- **Testing:** Vitest + `@vue/test-utils` (unit + component), Playwright (E2E)
- **Deploy:** static `dist/` bundle uploaded to S3

---

## Phase 1 — Project bootstrap ✓ DONE

- Vite + Vue + TS scaffold, path alias `@ → src`
- Vue Router with placeholder routes
- Pinia stores: `account`, `arcs`, `theme`
- `@authress/login` wired into the account store (login redirect on 401)
- Typed fetch-based API client (`src/lib/api.ts`) with neverthrow Result types
- App shell: top bar, sidebar, main outlet
- Catppuccin theme system: 4 flavors as CSS custom properties, persisted via
  the theme store, applied to `<html data-theme="…">`
- Vitest + Playwright configs and seed tests (component + e2e + style/color)
- ESLint 10 flat config + Prettier

## Phase 3 — Core inbox ✓ DONE

- Arc list (cursor-paginated) at `/`
- Per-row: urgency color stripe, workflow icon, summary, last-signal age, label chips
- Auth+critical arcs pinned to top of Inbox view
- Status tabs: Inbox (active) / Archived / All
- Bulk select + bulk archive + bulk label
- Empty / loading / error states
- `npm run check` gate: typecheck + ESLint (flat config) + Prettier + 39 unit/component tests

## Phase 4 — Arc detail ✓ DONE

- Route `/arcs/:id` with back navigation from arc rows
- Signals store: fetches arc + signals in parallel, newest-first display, cursor pagination
- Threaded signal list in `SignalCard.vue` (collapsible, sandboxed iframe, spam warning)
- Workflow-specific data panels for all 14 workflows (`src/components/panels/`)
  — auth, conversation, crm, package, travel, scheduling, payments, alert,
  content, status, healthcare, job, support, test
- `WorkflowPanel.vue` dispatcher (discriminated union narrowing via `workflow` field)
- `useCountdown.ts` composable (1s interval, urgency levels: safe/warning/critical/expired)
- `useClipboard.ts` composable (2s reset, silent failure)
- Reply composer (`ReplyComposer.vue`) — UI present, send disabled pending draft API
- Archive action on arc detail
- `npm run check` gate: all 56 tests pass

## Phase 5 — Quarantine view ✓ DONE

- Route `/quarantine`
- List of quarantined arcs (status=quarantined), filtered by sender and date
- Untrusted-sender branch: allow sender / block sender via alias PATCH
- Matched-rules branch: create rule to allow, create rule to block, edit rule, view all rules
- Filter by sender, date range

### Backend TODOs required to complete Phase 5

- **`Arc.matchedRules`** — add `matchedRules?: RuleExecution[]` to Arc where each entry has
  `{ ruleId: string; labels: string[]; status: string }`. Needed to show which rule fired and
  link to the rule editor.
- **`Arc.recipientAddress`** — expose `recipientAddress?: string` on quarantined arcs so the UI
  can target the correct alias when calling `PATCH /aliases/:address`.
- **`Arc.senderAddress`** — expose `senderAddress?: string` on quarantined arcs for display and
  for the allow/block alias PATCH body.
- **`EmailAddressConfig.blockedSenders`** — add `blockedSenders?: string[]` field to the alias
  config model and support `{ blockedSenders: string[] }` in `PATCH /aliases/:address` body.

## Phase 6 — Labels & views

- Manage labels (CRUD, color, icon)
- Custom sidebar views backed by saved searches
- Drag-to-reorder sidebar entries; persists to the account store / API

## Phase 7 — Rules engine

- Visual condition builder emitting JSONLogic
- Action list (label, snooze, forward, quarantine, auto-reply with a pong)
- Rule test runner that evaluates a sample signal against the rule

## Phase 8 — Search

- do full-text by calling the resource specific search endpoints passing in the same query
- Filter chips (workflow, label, urgency, date range, sender)
- Cursor-paginated results sharing the inbox row component
- which will search arcs, signals, sender emails, aliases, and rules as all separate searches, and then display those things in separate sections in the search results. After searching allow the user checkboxes to uncheck which of those things should not be displayed. Don't just use default checkbox display use good UX for managing those.

## Phase 9 — Settings

Tabs:

- Account profile
- Email addresses (sender + reply-to)
- Domains with two-tier DNS display (apex + DKIM/SPF/DMARC subrecords)
- Forwarding addresses
- Team / users (Authress RBAC: invite, role, remove)

## Phase 10 — Secondary screens

- Profile, billing, audit log, support panel
- Legal pages (terms, privacy)
- Notification preferences goes on the setting screen

## Phase 2 — Onboarding flow (deferred — build last)

Five-step wizard at `/onboarding`:

1. **Domain** — capture sending domain, show DNS records (two-tier display)
2. **Send test email** — render a real-time signal-arrival indicator (SSE or
   polling) so the user sees ingestion working end-to-end
3. **Sender setup** — pick a default sender address, set display name
4. **Filter mode** — choose strict / balanced / permissive default rule mode
5. **Done** — recap card, link into the inbox

---

## Testing strategy

- **Unit (Vitest, jsdom):** composables, stores, pure helpers (e.g. urgency →
  color mapping, JSONLogic emitter).
- **Component (Vitest + @vue/test-utils):** rendered output, Tailwind classes,
  ARIA, event emission.
- **E2E (Playwright):**
  - **Behavioral:** real user flows — log in, archive an arc, send a reply,
    walk the onboarding wizard end-to-end.
  - **Style / color:** assert computed colors per Catppuccin flavor so theme
    regressions are caught (e.g. high-urgency badge resolves to mauve in
    Mocha, lavender in Latte).

## Conventions

- All views in `src/views/*View.vue`, all reusable pieces in `src/components/`
- Stores own the network calls; views read state and dispatch actions
- `src/lib/api.ts` is the only place `fetch` is called
- All API calls return `Result<T, ApiError>` via neverthrow — stores branch on
  `.isOk()/.isErr()`, no try/catch at the store layer
- New colors and tokens go through the Catppuccin palette — never hard-code
  hex values in components
